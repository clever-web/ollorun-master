  purposes:
  <br />

<br />
<h4>CONSENT</h4>
<p>
  If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you

<h4>SECURITY</h4>
<p>
  Ollorun Finance LTD has taken strong measures to protect the
  security of your personal information and to ensure that your
  choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong
  precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized
  access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
  <br />
  <br />
  We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and
  secure. When you place orders or access your personal account
  information, you're utilizing secure server software SSL, which
  encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the
  Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies
  available.
  <br />
  <br />
  In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair
  Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you
  liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If
  your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover
  your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your
  credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from
  purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of
  unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit
  card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and
  procedures.
  <br />
  <br />
  Ollorun Finance LTD strictly protects the security of your
  personal information and honors your choices for its intended use.
  We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized
  access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
  <br />
  <br />
  Your personal information is never shared outside the company

  Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers
  with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed
  in United Kingdom or any other country where Ollorun Finance TLD,
  its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.
  <br />
  <br />
  You also have a significant role in protecting your information.
  No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing
  your username and password, so do not share these with others.
</p>
<br />
<br />
<h4>NOTICE TO PARENTS</h4>
<p>
  Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children's
  privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and
  responsible use of their Personal Information while using the
  Internet.
  <br />
  <br />
  The Ollorun Finance LTD site does not publish content that is
  targeted to children. However, if you are concerned about your
  children providing Ollorun Finance LTD any personal information
  without your consent, Ollorun Finance LTD offers a Kids account.
  It allows parents to give parental consent for the collection, use

<br />
<br />
<h4>CUSTOMER PROFILES</h4>
<p>
  As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique
  personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal
  identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can
  access your profile. When you register, we create your profile,
  assign a personal identification number, then send this personal
  identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a
  cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely
  yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across
  www.ollorun.com, allowing you to download free software, order

<br />
<h4>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</h4>
<p>
  When you join us, you provide us with your contact information,
  including your email address. We use this information to send you
  updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your
  satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and
  exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask
  for your credit card number and billing address. We use this
  information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that
  time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case
  you want to order from us again, but we don't use this information
  again without your permission.
  <br />
  <br />
  We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services
  on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering
  purchases, answering customer questions about products or
  services, sending postal mail and processing event registration.
  We will only provide those companies the information they need to
  deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that
  information for any other purpose.
  <br />
  <br />
  Ollorun Finance LTD will disclose your personal information,
  without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good
  faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the
  edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Ollorun
  Finance LTD or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or

<h4>3. WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h4>
<p>
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that may be stored
on your browser or the hard drive of your computer when you visit
our Platform. Cookies contain information about your visits to

<br />
<br />

<p>
Cookies are commonly used by Platforms to serve many different
functions. We use cookies on our Platform to allow us to tailor

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h4>5. HOW ARE COOKIES USED?</h4>
<p>
The web server providing the webpage can store a cookie on the
user's computer or mobile device. An external web server that
manages files included or referenced in the webpage is also able
to store cookies. All these cookies are called http header
cookies. Another way of storing cookies is through JavaScript code
contained or referenced in that page.
<br />
<br />
Each time the user requests a new page, the web server can receive
the values of the cookies it previously set and return the page
with content relating to these values. Similarly, JavaScript code
is able to read a cookie belonging to its domain and perform an
action accordingly.
<br />
<br />
We use “analytics” cookies, which, in conjunction with our web
server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of
people visiting our Platform and which parts of our Platform are
most popular. This helps us gather feedback so that we can improve
our Platform and better serve our users. We do not generally store
any personal information that you provide to us in a cookie.
<br />
<br />
We also use “social media” cookies to personalize your interaction
with third-party social media platforms such as Twitter and
Facebook, where our Platform uses such features. Such cookies
recognize users of these social media sites when you view social
media content on our Platform. They also allow you to quickly
share content across media, through the use of simple “sharing”
buttons.
</p>
<br />
<br />
<h4>6. WHAT ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOKIES?</h4>
<p>
<b>First-party cookies</b> – these are our own cookies set by our
Platform, controlled by us and used to provide information about
the usage of our Platform.
<br />
<br />
<b>Third-party cookies</b> – these are cookies from any other
domain. We use a number of suppliers that may also set cookies on
your device on our behalf when you visit our Platform to allow
them to deliver the services they are providing.
</p>
<br />
<br />
